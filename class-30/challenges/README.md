# Ops Challenge: Antivirus Evasion

## Overview

In the late 1980s, a virus named Brain infected 100,000 devices, causing noticeable slowdowns on infected systems. A young John McAfee reverse engineered the Brain virus and created an application designed specifically to remove Brain, called VirusScan. Afterwards, McAfee the company would quickly become well-known for its agent-based antimalware product lines.

The aspirational goal of any cyber attack design is for it to be FUD, or fully undetectable. It is important to understand how this is accomplished by the adversary, so as to increase your awareness of antivirus capabilities and more importantly, limitations. Today you will create a FUD meterpreter payload with Python.
